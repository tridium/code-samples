# Populating an implied tag from a direct tag

This example creates an implied tag (country) using a direct tag (town) to work out its value.

There is a TagDictionary in the palette that sets up the rule and tags to make this happen.
Add this to the station's Tag Dictionary Service.

Then add a 'town' tag to a component, with a value, say 'London' and then see that an implied 'country' tag (in this case with a value of 'England') has been added to the component.
