# Tridium Code Samples


This repo contains a range of example classes and modules.
They are intended to demonstrate isolated features of the Niagara framework.

The build structure for the initial push of the repo is based on 4.13 - from New Module Wizard and grunt-init-niagara.


\
**These are example modules and code and as such are not supported by [Tridium](https://www.tridium.com/).**

However, they can be used as is, or as a starting point to extend and develop other classes/modules.
